 Library Management System - README
-- Project Overview
This project is a complete SQL-based Library Management System designed to simulate real-world database operations. It includes database design, implementation using DDL commands, realistic data population using DML, query simulation as frontend API calls, and error-based learning with developer reflection.
üõ†Ô∏è Components Included
- SQL DDL Script (Table creation with constraints)
- Relational Mapping (Tables and Relationships)
- Normalization (UNF ‚Üí 1NF ‚Üí 2NF ‚Üí 3NF)
- Error Log (Realistic test actions + resolution)
- API-like SELECT queries (DQL practice)
- Developer Reflection
  -- File List
- Library_Implementation_Day2.sql
- Library_Mapping_Table.docx
- Library_Normalization_Practice.pdf
- SQL_Error_Log_and_API_Simulation.sql
- Corrected_Library_DML.sql
- Basic_SQL_API_Queries.sql
- Developer_Reflection_Summary.docx (optional)
  -- Skills Practiced
- SQL DDL, DML, DQL
- Primary/Foreign Keys, Constraints (CHECK, DEFAULT, NOT NULL)
- Error Debugging (FK violation, NULL, constraint errors)
- Thinking like a backend developer through test-driven SQL operations
--  Notes
This project was built and tested using SQL Server. Some features (e.g., IDENTITY, bit types, and constraints) may vary slightly across different SQL engines. All error-based testing was performed with realistic operations such as loaning, reviewing, and deleting dependent records.
